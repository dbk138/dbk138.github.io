Welcome to Code in the Wild. My name is Dan and I am a software developer from the Greater Philadelphia region. I have been developing software professionally for almost six years for companies both large and small. I currently work for a late stage start-up using PHP, Python, Scala, and JavaScript to maintain and develop applications.

This blog is intended to be my dumping ground for all things related to software and my career as a Software Engineer. That being said, in no way do my writings, ideas, or opinions reflect those of my employer.
